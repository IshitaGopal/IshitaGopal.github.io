I am a PhD candidate in <u>Political Science & Social Data Analytics</u> at the <u>Pennsylvania State University</u>. I will be starting as a Predoctoral Fellow at the  <u> Center for Social Data Analytics </u> in August 2021. My research uses computational social science approaches to study questions around digital media and political activism. Substantively, I focus on how different types of information shape the political choices of citizens and elites in the domain of dissent-repression, online communication and public policy decisions. Methodologically, I use causal inference, machine learning and network analysis in my work. 

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as an economist in the energy and enviroment domain in India. I also have a Master's in Economics from the University of Warwick.
