I am PhD candidate in <u>Political Science & Social Data Analytics</u> at the <u>Pennsylvania State University</u>. I am interested in topics of digital media and political activism. My work focusses on how different types of information shape the political choices of citizens and elites in the domain of dissent-repression, online cummunication and public policy decisions. My work employs computational social science methods and I have used causal inference, machine learning and network analysis in my work. 

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as an economist in the energy and enviroment domain in India. I also have a Master's in Economics from the University of Warwick.
