I am PhD candidate in Political Science & Social Data Analytics at the Pennsylvania State University. I apply causal inference, machine learning and network analysis methods to study digital media and political activism. Substantively, I focus on how different types of information shape the political choices of citizens and elites in the domain of dissent-repression, online cummunication and public policy decisions. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as an economist in the enrgy and enviroment domain in India. I also have a Master's in Economics from the University of Warwick.
